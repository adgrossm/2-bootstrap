      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="float-img"><img src="./assets/adampic.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="adam pic"></div><p>Life started on a hot July day in Perth Amboy, NJ. According to my mom I couldn't wait to arrive. I was born in the waiting room of the hospital because they didn't have time to get the deliery room ready. I spent my next 18 years in the same house and town. It was a typical childhood, friends, games, sports, and school.</p><p>I attended Indiana University and gained a BS in Public Management. While I was there I explored many new social and emotional pursuits. I graduated and decided to move back to NJ and start my career as a Customer Service Representative for an online brokerage firm. That job taught me a lot but for the next few years I was uncertain of my future career. I tried a few roles and realized that selling things was something I was really good at. In 2007 I met my wife at a July 4th party, we bought a house, had 2 kids then decided the rat race of NYC wasn't for us. We moved to Charlotte in 2014 and haven't looked back. I am currentnly exploring a new ideal which is coding and I am really excited about my opportunities and looking foward to see what the future holds.</p>
